To test my component, you would need to have the Pillow Module:
Input in the Windows Powershell
python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
python3 -m pip install --upgrade Pillow

Alternatively, for ease of marking, please run the .exe executable file instead, however, it is only for the final program. Otherwise, the program can be judged individually internally.
